def generate_random_graph(num_vertices):
    """
    Generates a random undirected graph represented by an adjacency list.

    The graph is constructed by randomly creating edges between vertices. 
    The probability of an edge being created between any two vertices is determined by a 
    randomly chosen probability p (0 <= p <= 1).

    Args:
        num_vertices (int): The number of vertices in the graph.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph, where the keys are 
              vertices (from 0 to num_vertices - 1) and the values are lists of neighboring vertices.
    
    Example:
        >>> generate_random_graph(5)
        {0: [1, 3], 1: [0], 2: [], 3: [0], 4: []}
